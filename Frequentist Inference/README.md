The purpose of this case study is to help apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. 

the z-statistic
the t-statistic
the difference and relationship between the two
the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
