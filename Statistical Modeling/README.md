The aim of this case study is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression to predict alcohol levels in wine with a model that's as accurate as possible. This project will have the following structure:
1. Sourcing and loading

Import relevant libraries
Load the data
Exploring the data
Choosing a dependent variable
2. Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing

Visualizing correlations
3. Modeling

Train/Test split
Making a Linear regression model: your first model
Making a Linear regression model: your second model: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
Making a Linear regression model: your third model: multiple linear regression
Making a Linear regression model: your fourth model: avoiding redundancy
4. Evaluating and concluding

Reflection
Which model was best?
Other regression algorithms
