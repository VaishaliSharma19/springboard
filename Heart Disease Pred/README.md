# Predicting Coronary Heart Disease Risk Using the Framingham Heart Study Dataset

*High cholesterol is one of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, which are among the top health conditions affecting millions worldwide. To better understand the factors contributing to coronary heart disease (CHD) and predict its likelihood, I decided to analyze the Framingham Heart Study dataset. This dataset provides valuable insights into the relationships between various health and lifestyle factors, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and smoking habits, and the onset of CHD. My objective was to determine if we could develop a reliable model to predict how likely an individual is to develop CHD, thus contributing to preventive healthcare efforts.*
